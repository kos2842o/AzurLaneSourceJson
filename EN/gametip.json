During this Daily Challenge, you'll be able to manually control your Submarines on a special stage and claim rewards by sinking enemy Cargo Ships.\n3. This Daily Challenge is available every day of the week, but you can only clear it 2 times per week.\n4. Submarines control differently from other vessels. They can't fire Salvos or launch Airstrikes, but instead, they have an ability called Dive.\n5. Additionally, they have an Emergency Boost that gives a short speed boost, a Torpedo Attack with limited uses, and an All Out Assault that they can use once.\n6. Furthermore, you can tap the icon in the top left corner to change which Submarine you're controlling.\n7. Once you clear the stage by sinking the Cargo Ships at the end of it, the points you earned during the Daily Challenge will be tallied\n8. You'll also receive Submarine and Anti-Sub gear based on how well you did.\n9. Points are given for clearing the stage, sinking enemies, and completing the stage without any of your Submarines sinking.\n10. Remember that your Submarines depend on their torpedoes to deal damage, so try to make every shot count.\n\nTips:\n1. Equipping your Submarine correctly will give them more ammunition to use. Both Auxiliary and Main Weapon torpedoes count!\n2. Submarine skills don't work during the Daily Challenge, so plan your strategy accordingly.\n3. However, they can still use their All Out Assaults once.\n4. Surcouf will fire her All Out Assault automatically when she resurfaces, but like all other Submarines, she can only fire it once.\n5. All Out Assaults deal increased damage to enemies during this Daily Challenge.\n6. You can't change to another Submarine to control immediately after Diving or Resurfacing.\n\nEscort Cargo is available on Mondays, Thursdays, and Sundays.\n\nMaritime Attack is available on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.\n\nFierce Assault is available on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\nTactical Training is available every day of the week.\n<color=#92fc63>Airstrikes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Aviation)</color>.\n<color=#92fc63>Main Fleet Salvos</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Shelling)</color>.\n<color=#92fc63>Vanguard Torpedoes</color> are highly effective for <color=#92fc63>Tactical Training (Torpedo)</color>."

        "info": "<color=#FFDD00>Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019</color>\n\nAbout the Popularity Poll:\n The Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 consists of two parts: in-game voting, and website voting. The Poll has 3 main rounds: Qualifiers, Groups, and Finals. \n For each step of voting, the candidates that advance to the next step are determined by the combined totals of in-game voting across all servers, and website voting.\n\nPopularity Poll Rules:\n Qualifiers round:\n All characters, excluding Hall of Fame characters, that were implemented prior to 8/29/2019 are in the Qualifiers, meaning a total of 298 characters. The top 150 characters with the most votes advance to the Groups round.\n The Qualifiers round will be hosted in-game only.\n Note: during the Qualifiers round, a character's number of votes will not be displayed, only their ranking.\n Qualifiers Comeback round:\n Characters that lost the Qualifiers enter a separate vote. The top 10 characters from this vote get the chance to appear in the Finals Comeback round.\n The Qualifiers Comeback round will be hosted on a special webpage only.\n Groups round:\n Characters that advanced to the Groups round are sorted into 5 groups of 30 ships per group. Each character competes for votes within their own group. The top 3 characters with the most votes within each group advances to the Finals while the top 4 to 10 characters from each group are sent to the Finals Comeback round.\n Finals Comeback round:\n The top 4 to 10 characters of each group and the top 10 from the Qualifiers Comeback will participate in this separate vote. The top 9 characters who receive the most votes will advance to the Finals.\n Finals round:\n The Finals consist of 15 characters from the Groups round and 9 from the Finals Comeback round, for a total of 24 characters.\n Final Result Calculation:\n Once each step has concluded, the website votes will be weighted then added to the in-game votes to calculate the final vote count.\n In the event of a tie, the character who reached that number of votes first will advance.\n\nFinal Results Announcement:\n Once each step has concluded, barring the Finals round, the voting results will be announced the next day at 12:00 in-game and on the website.\n Once the Finals round has concluded, the final results will be announced on Twitter and Facebook the following day after server maintenance.\n\nHow to Vote:\n In-game Voting:\n Players with a Commander level of 25 and above can obtain Ballots through the following 2 ways:\n 1: By completing special missions available during the voting period. These can be viewed from the Missions menu.\n 2: By sortieing and defeating Boss nodes in Campaign mode to earn a Certificate of Support.\n Players can use their Certificate of Support on the Campaign overworld screen or the Popularity Poll banner to receive Support Points.\n Support Points will in turn give the player Ballots based on how many Points he/she earned.\n The player can then use their Ballots to vote for their favorite characters with the Vote button on the Popularity Poll banner.\n Please note that once each step of the Poll has concluded, all remaining Ballots will disappear.\n\nAbout Certificates of Support:\n 1. Players can obtain a Certificate of Support by defeating Boss nodes on Campaign (Normal mode only) and Event maps (excluding through War Archives.)\n 2. Players cannot possess more than 1 Certificate of Support at a time. It can be used on the Campaign overworld map or from the Popularity Poll banner.\n 3. When using their Certificate of Support, players will be sent to a screen with the chibi sprites of several characters. By tapping the chibis in the direction that the Manjuu is pointing, the Certificate of Support will be spent and the player will receive Support Points.\n 4. The Certificate of Support will disappear if not used within a certain timespan.\n 5. Certificates of Support obtained from higher level Campaign maps give more Support Points.\n\tChapter 3: 120 Points\n\tChapter 4: 150 Points\n\tChapter 5: 180 Points\n\tChapter 6: 220 Points\n\tChapter 7: 270 Points\n\tChapter 8: 350 Points\n\tChapter 9: 450 Points\n\tChapter 10: 550 Points\n\tChapter 11: 700 Points\n\tChapter 12: 850 Points\n\nYou can check the in-game Help button for more details on the above.\n\nWebsite Voting:\n Players can vote on their favorite characters once a day by visiting the Azur Lane Popularity Poll 2019 website after binding their Twitter or Facebook account to it.\n Players can vote a second time by using the Share button to post their character choices on Twitter. Please note that you can only vote a maximum of 2 times a day from the same device.\n The link to the Popularity Poll website will be posted on the official Azur Lane Twitter and Facebook accounts.\n\nVoting Schedule:\n Qualifiers (in-game only): Begins after the 29/8 maintenance, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 5/9.\n Qualifiers Comeback (web voting only): Begins at 00:00 PDT on 12/9, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 23/9.\n Group A: Begins at 00:00 PDT on 12/9, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 16/9.\n Group B: Begins at 00:00 PDT on 19/9, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 23/9.\n Group C: Begins at 00:00 PDT on 26/9, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 30/9.\n Group D: Begins at 00:00 PDT on 3/10, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 7/10.\n Group E: Begins at 00:00 PDT on 10/10, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 14/10.\n Finals Comeback: Begins at 00:00 PDT on 17/10, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 21/10.\n Finals: Begins at 14:00 on 24/10, lasts until 23:59 PDT on 30/10.\n"

You must complete the Rescue Mission or let its timer run out before you can get another Rescue Mission for the same Chapter.\n- A Rescue Mission will disappear once you've cleared it or 12 hours have passed.\n\nSignal Sensitivity:\n- Your Signal Sensitivity dictates which Chapters you may receive Distress Signals from.\n- At Sensitivity level 1, Rescue Missions will only appear in Chapter 3.\n- As you increase your Signal Sensitivity level, you will gain access to Rescue Missions in higher Chapters on the world map.\n- You can increase your Signal Sensitivity by 1 level by S-Ranking the Boss Node on your currently highest level available Rescue Mission. Your Signal Sensitivity caps out at level 8.\n- Additionally, the higher your Sensitivity level, the better the rewards you may receive from clearing the Boss Node.\n\nCombat Details:\n- You will encounter enemy Submarines during Rescue Missions. Before you attempt a Rescue Mission, it's recommended that you first equip your DDs and CLs with Anti-Sub gear.\n\n"

You unlock these buffs by collecting and getting your ships to a high level.\n3. <color=#92fc63>The buffs apply to ships which have been fully Limit Broken.</color>\n4. In essence, you will gain the most benefits by leveling all the ships you have in your Dock.\n\nThe Tech Mechanics can be separated into two distinct types: Fleet Tech and Faction Tech.\n\nFleet Tech:\n1. The Fleet Tech mechanic grants buffs, which are unlocked by leveling your ships, to your entire fleet. \n2. You can view your collection and Tech acquisition statuses on the Fleet Tech screen.\n3. The ships are sorted into tiers based on their historical technology development order.\n4. When you complete the following achievements with a ship, your entire fleet will receive the corresponding stat buff(s) associated with her group:\n - <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> the ship in your Library - Getting the ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>\n5. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive buffs from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them.\n\n<color=#92fc63>Faction Tech</color>:\n1. Faction Tech is a mechanic that gives stat buffs to your entire fleet based on your Tech Level with each faction.\n2. You can view a faction's Tech Level and the buffs it gives to your fleet by tapping its corresponding tab on the Faction Tech screen.\n3. By increasing a faction's Tech Level, you can further increase the buffs that it gives.\n4. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you must spend <color=#92fc63>Coins</color> and meet the Tech Point requirement for that faction.\n5. Lastly, you can only increase the Tech level of one faction at a time.\n\nAbout Tech Points:\n1. To increase a faction's Tech Level, you need to have collected a certain amount of Tech Points from ships of that faction. \n2. From the Faction Tech screen, you can view how many Tech Points you have with each faction.\n3. You can acquire Tech Points through the following means:\n- <color=#92fc63>Registering</color> a new ship in your Library- <color=#92fc63>Fully Limit Breaking</color> a ship- Getting a ship to <color=#92fc63>Level 120</color>\n4. Please note: if you have 2 or more copies of the same ship, you will only receive Tech Points from <color=#92fc63>1</color> of them."

# AzurLaneSourceJson
Lua data files converted to json. Because i can't be bothered to use lupa.  
This will not be updated automatically. Just because.

The original lua source can be found here: https://github.com/Dimbreath/AzurLaneData  
The converter used and other tools can be found here: https://github.com/nobbyfix/AzurLaneTools
